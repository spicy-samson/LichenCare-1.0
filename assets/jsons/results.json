    "Annular Lichen Planus" : {
        "Description" : "Annular Lichen Planus (ALP) is a less common variant of the cutaneous lichen planus that is characterized by a ring-shaped or annular pattern of lesions on the skin. The rings may be solitary or multiple and can occur anywhere on the patient’s body, but are commonly found on the arms, legs, and trunk.",

            "Header" : "Annular Lichen Planus is commonly characterized by its ring-shaped or annular lesion on the skin. The following are the better-known symptoms of the Annular Lichen Planus with its distinctive features:",
            "Features": {
                "Annular or Ring-shaped Lesions": "The hallmark of Annular Lichen Planus is the presence of circular or oval-shaped, raised, reddish, or purplish plaques on the skin wherein these lesions have a distinct border and a central area that may appear less inflamed.",
                "Itching": "ALP are usually pruritic which means they tend to be itchy and uncomfortable.",
                "Central Clearing": "One characteristic feature of ALP is the central clearing of the lesion wherein the skin in the middle of the ring is relatively unaffected and may appear closer to normal skin.",
                "Koebner Phenomenon":"The Koebner Phenomenon (KP) is the appearance of new skin lesions on previously unaffected skin secondary. In the case of ALP and Lichen Planus in general, it can develop in areas of skin trauma or injury, such as scratches or burns.",
                "Symmetrical Distribution" : "ALP lesions often occur in a symmetrical pattern as they appear on both sides of the body, mirroring each other. They can develop on various parts of the body, including the arms, legs, trunk, and genital area.",
                "Hyperpigmentation/Hypopigmentation" : "After the annular lesions resolve, they may leave behind areas of Hyperpigmentation (darkening of the skin) or Hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin). These pigment changes can persist for some time.",
                "Nail Involvement" : "In some rare cases, Lichen Planus can affect the nails, causing ridges, pitting, or other changes."

                "Phototherapy": "Ultraviolet (UV) light therapy, including UVB or PUVA (psolaren plus UVA), is a light treatment that can be beneficial for some patients to clear the skin.",
                "Retinoids": "Oral or topical retinoids can be considered to be used to help control inflammation and promote healing of the skin.",
                "Immunosuppressants": "In case of severe or refractory Lichen Planus, immune-modulating medications such as methotrexate or cyclosporine prescribed by a dermatologist can be used in alleviating the pain.",
                "Topical Corticosteroids": "Topical corticosteroid creams or ointments are often the first-line treatment for Lichen Planus as these can help reduce inflammation and itching. Higher-potency corticosteroids may be necessary for thicker lesions.",
                "Topical Calcineurin Inhibitors" : "Tacrolimus ointment and pimecrolimus cream are topical immunosuppressive medicaments for sensitive areas if corticosteroids are not suitable."
